= A simple HTTP server strictly for development and static content


== Development Server

The server is optimised for development only:

* Nothing is cached. So changes can be seen immediately.
* This means performance is good enough for a couple of developers but it would go down with more traffic.


== Static Server

Only static content is served. No forms can be filled and dynamic content isn't supported.


== Only GET Requests

Only HTTP get requests are supported. The content has to get to the server in a different way.
Usually the content is edited directly in the directory it is served from.
But of course content can get there via scp too.
